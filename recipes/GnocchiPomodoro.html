        <h3>Recipe for Gnocchi al pomodoro</h3>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Ah, the delightful dance of dough and potatoes, twirling together in a tantalizing tango of flavor – that's gnocchi for you! This beloved Italian dish has a history as rich as its taste.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Legend has it that gnocchi dates back to ancient Roman times when clever cooks repurposed leftover bread into little dumplings.
                But it wasn't until the introduction of the humble potato from the New World that gnocchi truly soared to starchy stardom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Picture this: Italy, centuries ago, hungry peasants pondering what to do with their potatoes. Lo and behold, someone had a stroke of culinary genius – mix those spuds with flour, roll 'em into little pillows, and boil 'em up.
                Thus, gnocchi was born, a dish so comforting it could make even the grumpiest nonna crack a smile.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, why is gnocchi such a classic, you ask? Well, aside from being downright delicious, gnocchi embodies everything we love about Italian cuisine – simplicity, tradition, and a whole lot of amore. 
                It's versatile too! You can dress it up with a rich tomato sauce, smother it in creamy Gorgonzola, or keep it classic with a simple sage and butter drizzle.
